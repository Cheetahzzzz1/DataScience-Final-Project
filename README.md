# Data-Science-Final-Project

# Overview

This project focuses on Credit Risk Prediction, a critical area in financial analytics. It leverrages machine learning to help financial institutions identify high-risk loans, mitigate risk and enhance decision-making processes.

# Project Steps

1. Cleaning the dataset by removing unnecessary null values.

2. Implementing machine learning models such as Random Forest and Linear Regression.

3. Analyzing and visualizing the relationships between various features and the loan amount using graphical representations.

# Prerequisites

1. pandas

2. numpy

3. matplotlib

4. seaborn

5. sklearn

6. datetime

# Project Details

<ins> Part 1: Data Cleaning </ins>

The dataset is first cleaned to remove unnecessary null values using the following steps:

1. Columns with a high percentage of null values are dropped.

2. Missiong values in remaining columns are handled appropriately.

3. New features are engineered where necessary.

<ins> Part 2: Random Forest Model </ins>

1. A Random Forest Classifier is implemented to classify the data.

2. Accuracy achieved: 91%

<ins> Part 3: Linear Regression Model </ins>

1. A Linear Regression model is trained and evaluated to predict the loan amount.

<ins> Part 4: Visualization </ins>

1. Various features of the data are compared with the loan amount using graphs.

2. Insights are drawn to highlight significant trends and patterns.

# Results 

1. The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of 91%.

2. The visualizations provided key insights into the relationships between features and loan amounts.

# Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates data cleaning, feature engineering and application of machine learning models for classification and regresssion tasks. The insights gained from the visualizations can be used to improve decision-making processes related to loans.
